## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd StudentInfoSystem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase Database**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the SQL script from `supabase_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Note your project URL and anon key

4. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open http://localhost:5000
   - Login with default credentials:
     - **Principal**: `principal` / `principal123`
     - **Teacher**: `teacher` / `teacher123`
     - **Student**: `student1` / `student123`

## Database Schema

The system uses the following Supabase tables:

- **users**: User accounts with roles and authentication
- **students**: Student information and face data
- **teachers**: Teacher information and subjects
- **marks**: Subject-wise student marks
- **grades**: Subject-wise student grades
- **attendance**: Daily attendance records with face data

## Security Features

### üîí **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Database-level access control
- Role-based data access policies
- Secure data isolation between users

### üõ°Ô∏è **Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based route protection

### üîê **Data Protection**
- Encrypted face data storage
- Secure API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
